What is my site's primary purpose? 
To be a testing ground for learning to code, displaying what I have learned.

Who is your target audience?
Anyone interested in my coding skills, friends, family, employers, interested parties.

How do I want visitors to intereact with my site? What experience would I like them to have?
I'd like them to be able to look at my dev blog, or any projects I've made and be able to contact me.

How will I build my site to support my desired user experience? 
On the home page nav bar, I will have links to my blog, projects, and contact/about me. Currently I just have links to my blog posts, so I might move them all to one page and have jump links to scroll down quickly if you don't want to read them all.
