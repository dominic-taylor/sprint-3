What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works? 


The layout becomes more veritcal and a user can scroll down to see the content rather than scrolling around the page and zooming in/out to see everything. I think it works by using media queries in the CSS to change the layout of the content as the size changes, though I note the skeleton CSS is designed for mobile first, and smaller than 500px layout is actually the default.
